Introduction
----------------------------------

SecureVault Pro is a robust, desktop-based application designed to securely store and manage your sensitive login credentials. Built with a focus on security and user privacy, it uses strong encryption algorithms to protect your data locally on your computer. This document provides a detailed overview of its features and functionalities.

----------------------------------
Core Features
----------------------------------

1.  **Secure Encrypted Vault:**
    *   **Master Password:** The entire vault is protected by a single, strong Master Password that you create. This is the only password you need to remember.
    *   **End-to-End Encryption:** All your data, including usernames, passwords, URLs, and notes, is encrypted using the industry-standard AES-256 GCM algorithm. The encryption and decryption happen locally on your device, ensuring that only you can access your information.
    *   **Key Derivation:** The encryption key is derived from your Master Password using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 and a unique salt, making it highly resistant to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Data Integrity:** The application uses HMAC-SHA256 signatures to verify the integrity of your vault files, protecting them from tampering or corruption.

2.  **Account Management:**
    *   **Add, Edit, and Delete Accounts:** Easily manage your login credentials for various websites and applications.
    *   **Detailed Entries:** Each entry can store a name, username/email, password, website URL, and personal notes.
    *   **Quick Search:** A search bar allows you to instantly find the account you're looking for by name, email, or URL.
    *   **Copy to Clipboard:** Securely copy your password to the clipboard with a single click. For security, the clipboard is automatically cleared after 30 seconds.

3.  **Password Generator:**
    *   **Customizable Generation:** Create strong, random passwords with customizable length (from 8 to 64 characters).
    *   **Character Options:** You can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.
    *   **Exclude Ambiguous Characters:** An option to exclude characters that can be easily confused (e.g., '0' and 'O', '1' and 'l') is available.
    *   **Strength Analysis:** The generator provides real-time feedback on the strength of the generated password.

4.  **Security Dashboard:**
    *   **Security Report:** Get an overview of your password security health. The report identifies weak passwords, reused (duplicate) passwords, and provides overall statistics.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Add an extra layer of security to your vault. When enabled, you'll need a 6-digit code from an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) in addition to your Master Password to log in.

5.  **Data Backup and Restore:**
    *   **Encrypted Backups:** Create encrypted backup files (`.svbk`) of your entire vault. These backups are protected with a separate backup code that you provide.
    *   **Secure Restore:** Restore your vault from a backup file. This is useful for migrating to a new computer or recovering from data loss.
    *   **Backup Preview:** You can preview the contents (manifest) of a backup file before restoring it.

6.  **User Interface and Experience:**
    *   **Modern UI:** A clean, intuitive graphical user interface built with CustomTkinter, available in a dark theme.
    *   **Inactivity Lock:** The application automatically locks and closes after 2 minutes of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Loading Screen:** A startup screen provides feedback while the application initializes its secure components.

How It Works
----------------------------------

When you first set up SecureVault, you create a Master Password. This password, combined with a randomly generated salt, is used to create a powerful encryption key. This key is never stored directly. Instead, it is generated on-the-fly each time you log in.

All the account information you save is encrypted with this key before being written to the database files on your computer's disk. When you need to view or copy a password, the application decrypts it in memory just long enough for you to use it.

This design ensures that even if someone gains access to your computer's files, they cannot read your passwords without knowing your Master Password.

----------------------------------
Security Best Practices
----------------------------------

*   **Use a Strong Master Password:** Make it long, complex, and something you have never used anywhere else.
*   **Enable 2FA:** This provides a critical second layer of defense.
*   **Keep Backup Codes Safe:** Write down your backup codes and store them in a secure physical location, separate from your computer and your backup files.
*   **Create Regular Backups:** Store your backup files in a safe place, such as an external hard drive or a secure cloud storage service.
