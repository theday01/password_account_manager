        "about_text": """SecureVault Pro is a robust, desktop-based application designed to securely store and manage your sensitive login credentials. Built with a focus on security and user privacy, it uses strong encryption algorithms to protect your data locally on your computer.

### How It Works

When you first set up SecureVault, you create a Master Password. This password, combined with a randomly generated salt, is used to create a powerful encryption key. This key is never stored directly. Instead, it is generated on-the-fly each time you log in.

All the account information you save is encrypted with this key before being written to the database files on your computer's disk. When you need to view or copy a password, the application decrypts it in memory just long enough for you to use it.

This design ensures that even if someone gains access to your computer's files, they cannot read your passwords without knowing your Master Password.

### Security Best Practices

*   **Use a Strong Master Password:** Make it long, complex, and something you have never used anywhere else.
*   **Enable 2FA:** This provides a critical second layer of defense.
*   **Keep Backup Codes Safe:** Write down your backup codes and store them in a secure physical location, separate from your computer and your backup files.
*   **Create Regular Backups:** Store your backup files in a safe place, such as an external hard drive or a secure cloud storage service.

    • NEVER share your backup code with anyone

    💾 BACKUP FILE SAFETY:

    • Make multiple copies in different safe locations
    • Test your backup restoration periodically

هذا البرنامج هو خزنتك الرقمية الشخصية لكلمات المرور، وهو مصمم بحيث لا يفتحه إلا أنت!

**كيف يعمل:**
1.  **كلمة مرور رئيسية واحدة:** تقوم بإنشاء كلمة مرور رئيسية واحدة قوية. هذه هي الكلمة الوحيدة التي تحتاج إلى تذكرها.
2.  **تشفير قوي:** عند حفظ كلمة مرور لموقع ويب أو تطبيق، يقوم البرنامج بتشفيرها إلى رمز سري باستخدام كلمة مرورك الرئيسية.
3.  **تخزين آمن:** يتم تخزين هذا الرمز السري بشكل آمن على جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بك. بدون كلمة مرورك الرئيسية، لا يمكن لأي شخص آخر قراءته.
4.  **وصول سهل:** عندما تحتاج إلى كلمة مرور، ما عليك سوى فتح البرنامج باستخدام كلمة مرورك الرئيسية، وسيقوم بفك تشفير الرمز السري لك.

فكر في الأمر كمفكرة شخصية مقفلة. أنت فقط من يملك المفتاح (كلمة مرورك الرئيسية) لفتحها وقراءة محتوياتها.

SecureVault Pro هو مدير كلمات مرور لسطح المكتب يركز على توفير أمان وخصوصية محليين قويين.
يتم تشفير جميع بيانات الخزنة (أسماء المستخدمين، كلمات المرور، الروابط، والملاحظات) محليًا باستخدام تشفير AES-256-GCM.
يُشتق مفتاح التشفير من كلمة المرور الرئيسية الخاصة بك عبر خوارزمية PBKDF2 (SHA-256) مع "ملح" فريد لكل مستخدم،
ويتم التحقق من سلامة الملفات باستخدام HMAC-SHA256.

تشمل القدرات الأساسية إضافة وتعديل وحذف إدخالات الحسابات التفصيلية، والبحث السريع،
والنسخ الآمن إلى الحافظة (يتم مسحها تلقائيًا بعد 30 ثانية)، ومولّد كلمات مرور قابل للتخصيص
(الطول من 8 إلى 64 حرفًا، مع خيارات للأحرف الكبيرة والصغيرة والأرقام والرموز، وإمكانية استبعاد الأحرف المتشابهة).
توفر لوحة معلومات الأمان تقريرًا عن صحة كلمات المرور (الضعيفة والمكررة) ودعمًا اختياريًا للمصادقة الثنائية.

النسخ الاحتياطية هي ملفات مشفرة بامتداد `.svbk` محمية برمز نسخ احتياطي منفصل؛ يمكنك معاينة محتويات النسخة الاحتياطية
قبل استعادتها. تم تصميم واجهة المستخدم باستخدام CustomTkinter (مع توفر مظهر داكن)، وتتضمن قفلًا تلقائيًا
بعد دقيقتين من عدم النشاط، وشاشة تحميل عند بدء التشغيل تتحقق من سلامة الخزنة أثناء التهيئة.
