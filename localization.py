### How It Works

When you first set up SecureVault, you create a Master Password. This password, combined with a randomly generated salt, is used to create a powerful encryption key. This key is never stored directly. Instead, it is generated on-the-fly each time you log in.

All the account information you save is encrypted with this key before being written to the database files on your computer's disk. When you need to view or copy a password, the application decrypts it in memory just long enough for you to use it.

This design ensures that even if someone gains access to your computer's files, they cannot read your passwords without knowing your Master Password.

### Security Best Practices

*   **Use a Strong Master Password:** Make it long, complex, and something you have never used anywhere else.
*   **Keep Backup Codes Safe:** Write down your backup codes and store them in a secure physical location, separate from your computer and your backup files.
*   **Create Regular Backups:** Store your backup files in a safe place, such as an external hard drive or a secure cloud storage service.

    • DO NOT store the backup code digitally on the same device
    • Consider storing the code in multiple SECURE physical locations

    🔒 BACKUP SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
    • Use a STRONG, UNIQUE backup code (minimum 12 characters)
    • Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
    • NEVER share your backup code with anyone
    • Store backups and codes in SEPARATE secure locations

    💾 BACKUP FILE SAFETY:
    • Store backup files (.svbk) in secure, encrypted storage
    • Make multiple copies in different safe locations
    • Test your backup restoration periodically
