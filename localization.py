This program is your personal digital safe for passwords, only you open it!

How it works:
1. You create a single, strong Master Password. This is the only password you need to remember.

2. When you save a password for a website or app, the program scrambles it into a secret code using your Master Password.

3. This secret code is stored securely on your computer. Without your Master Password, it's just gibberish to anyone else.

4. When you need a password, you unlock the program with your Master Password, and it unscrambles the secret code back into your password for you to use.

Think of it like a locked diary. Only you have the key (your Master Password) to open it and read what's inside.

SecureVault Pro is a desktop password manager focused on strong local security and privacy.
All vault data (usernames, passwords, URLs, notes) is encrypted locally using AES-256-GCM.
The encryption key is derived from your Master Password via PBKDF2 (SHA-256) with a unique salt,
and file integrity is verified with HMAC-SHA256.

Core capabilities include adding/editing/deleting detailed account entries, a quick search,
secure copy-to-clipboard (automatically cleared after 30 seconds), and a customizable password generator
(length 8–64, uppercase/lowercase/digits/symbols, option to exclude ambiguous characters).
A Security Dashboard provides a password-health report (weak/duplicate passwords) and optional 2FA support.

Backups are encrypted `.svbk` files protected by a separate backup code; you can preview a backup's manifest
before restoring. The UI is built with CustomTkinter (dark theme available), includes an inactivity lock
(2 minutes) and a startup loading screen that checks vault integrity during initialization.

هذا البرنامج هو خزنتك الرقمية الشخصية لكلمات المرور، لا يفتحه إلا أنت!

كيف يعمل:
1. تقوم بإنشاء كلمة مرور رئيسية واحدة قوية. هذه هي كلمة المرور الوحيدة التي تحتاج إلى تذكرها.

2. عند حفظ كلمة مرور لموقع ويب أو تطبيق، يقوم البرنامج بتشفيرها إلى رمز سري باستخدام كلمة المرور الرئيسية الخاصة بك.

3. يتم تخزين هذا الرمز السري بشكل آمن على جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بك. بدون كلمة المرور الرئيسية الخاصة بك، يكون مجرد هراء لأي شخص آخر.

4. عندما تحتاج إلى كلمة مرور، تقوم بإلغاء قفل البرنامج باستخدام كلمة المرور الرئيسية الخاصة بك، ويقوم بفك تشفير الرمز السري مرة أخرى إلى كلمة المرور الخاصة بك لتستخدمها.

فكر في الأمر على أنه مذكرات مقفلة. أنت فقط لديك المفتاح (كلمة المرور الرئيسية الخاصة بك) لفتحه وقراءة ما بداخله.

SecureVault Pro هو مدير كلمات مرور لسطح المكتب يركز على الأمان والخصوصية المحليين القويين.
يتم تشفير جميع بيانات الخزنة (أسماء المستخدمين وكلمات المرور وعناوين URL والملاحظات) محليًا باستخدام AES-256-GCM.
يتم اشتقاق مفتاح التشفير من كلمة المرور الرئيسية الخاصة بك عبر PBKDF2 (SHA-256) مع ملح فريد،
ويتم التحقق من سلامة الملف باستخدام HMAC-SHA256.

تشمل القدرات الأساسية إضافة/تعديل/حذف إدخالات الحسابات المفصلة، والبحث السريع،
والنسخ الآمن إلى الحافظة (يتم مسحه تلقائيًا بعد 30 ثانية)، ومولد كلمات مرور قابل للتخصيص
(الطول 8-64، أحرف كبيرة/صغيرة/أرقام/رموز، خيار استبعاد الأحرف الغامضة).
توفر لوحة معلومات الأمان تقريرًا عن صحة كلمة المرور (كلمات مرور ضعيفة/مكررة) ودعمًا اختياريًا للمصادقة الثنائية.

النسخ الاحتياطية هي ملفات مشفرة `.svbk` محمية برمز نسخ احتياطي منفصل؛ يمكنك معاينة بيان النسخة الاحتياطية
قبل الاستعادة. تم تصميم واجهة المستخدم باستخدام CustomTkinter (يتوفر مظهر داكن)، وتتضمن قفل عدم النشاط
